Her journey to find a true manufacturing partner was fueled by her unwavering passion for excellence. However, she faced numerous disappointments with manufacturers who delivered inconsistent quality, slow turnaround times, and unpredictable pricing. These challenges only strengthened her resolve, leading her to establish DesigNova Studiosâ€”a place where her vision for consistent, high-quality craftsmanship could finally be realized.</p>
